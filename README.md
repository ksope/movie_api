# myFlix_movie_api

DESCRIPTION
Welcome to my project! The myFlix Movie API will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies. 

This is a  web application using the following frameworks, libraries and database:
- Express was used as Server-Side Web Framework
- Postgresql was first used to test API using a relational database. MongoDB was used next as a Non Relational database, then database was finally uploaded on MongoAtlas so that API data can be accessible  from anywhere using a browser.
- Node.js was used to build API modules
- NPM was used a package manager to install 3rd party packages
- Moongoose was used as the Business Logic Layer to connect the server and endpoints with the database
- Authentication is done using jwt (token based) authentication
- The database was connected to the API on Heroku
